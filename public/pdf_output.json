Any transactions\nconducted between a payer (or its\nagent) and the recipient in a 24-hour\nperiod are related transactions.\nTransactions are considered related\neven if they occur over a period of more\nthan 24 hours if the recipient knows, or\nhas reason to know, that each\ntransaction is one of a series of\nconnected transactions.\n\nKeep a copy of each Form 8300 for 5\nyears from the date you file it.\n\nClerks of federal or state courts must\nfile Form 8300 if more than $10,000 in\ncash is received as bail for an\nindividual(s) charged with certain criminal\noffenses. For these purposes, a clerk\nincludes the clerk’s office or any other\noffice, department, division, branch, or\nunit of the court that is authorized to\nreceive bail. If a person receives bail on\nbehalf of a clerk, the clerk is treated as\nreceiving the bail.

    "text": "THE TJX COMPANIES, INC.\nANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY FOR U.S. DIVISIONS\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nThe TJX Companies, Inc. (“TJX”) is committed to doing business in accordance with the highest\nethical standards and in compliance with the law. Accordingly, TJX has adopted this Anti-Money\nLaundering (“AML”) Policy in an effort to detect, prevent, and report potential money laundering\nand other unusual or suspicious activity during customer transactions.\nAll TJX associates in the United States who conduct or directly supervise in-store transactions at\npoint-of-sale (“Covered Persons”) must understand and comply with this policy. Any Covered\nPerson found to be in violation of this policy shall be subject to appropriate corrective action, up to\nand including termination of employment or services and/or legal action.\nTJX has designated its Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) to serve as its AML Compliance Officer.\nIn consultation with the Legal Department, the CCO is responsible for coordinating TJX’s overall\ncompliance strategy and monitoring day-to-day operations and internal controls under this policy.\nWHAT IS MONEY LAUNDERING?\nMoney laundering can be defined as activity intended to conceal the true origins of proceeds obtained\nthrough criminal conduct, such that the proceeds appear to have been obtained through legitimate\nconduct. Money laundering is punishable by fines and/or imprisonment.\nWHAT DOES THIS POLICY REQUIRE?\n1. Reporting Cash Transactions Over $10,000\nTo detect potential money laundering activity in the United States, all Covered Persons are required to\nensure that any customer making an in-store cash purchase totaling more than $10,000, or a series\nof related cash purchases totaling more than $10,000, complete the IRS/FinCEN Form 8300\n(“Form 8300”) at point-of-sale. The Form 8300 has been attached to this policy.\nWhat does “cash” mean?\nIn this context, “cash” includes not only currency (such as paper money and coins), but also cashier’s\nchecks, traveler’s checks, and money orders. Cash does not include personal checks or payments\nmade by credit, debit, or gift card.\nWhat types of goods count towards the total purchase amount?\nAll goods sold by TJX qualify towards the total purchase amount. The total purchase can be\ncomprised of either a single good or multiple goods.\nWhat does it mean for cash purchases to be “related”?\nCash purchases are “related” when: 1) a customer engages in multiple in-store transactions that\ntogether total more than $10,000 within a 24-hour period; or 2) the Covered Person knows or has\nreason to know that a series of transactions are connected, even if they occur more than 24 hours\napart. Like single cash purchases, “related” cash purchases must be reported on the Form 8300.\n1\nJune 2015",

    "text": "What should I do after the customer completes the Form 8300?\nImmediately following the transaction, the Covered Person should provide the completed Form 8300\nto his or her direct supervisor, who is then responsible for transmitting the completed form to the Chief\nCompliance Officer within two business days. The CCO is responsible for filing the Form 8300 with\nthe IRS/FinCEN within 15 days of the cash transaction. The CCO is also responsible for maintaining\ncopies of any forms submitted to the authorities for five years from the date of filing.\n2. Internal Reporting of Other Unusual or Suspicious Activity\nAll Covered Persons also must be alert for other unusual or suspicious activity that raises potential\nmoney laundering concerns. Any such activity must be reported to the Covered Person’s direct\nsupervisor, who in turn should contact the CCO for further inquiry. Examples of potential unusual\nor suspicious activity include, but are not limited to:\n• attempts by a single individual to purchase large volumes of goods that are inconsistent with\nordinary needs;\n• multiple cash transactions at the same retail location that approach, but do not exceed, the\n$10,000 reporting threshold; and\n• a customer’s refusal to provide the information required on the Form 8300.\nWHAT SHOULD I DO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\nAny Covered Person who has questions about whether a particular transaction constitutes a reportable\nevent under this policy should raise the issue with his or her direct supervisor. The TJX Helpline is\nan additional resource for Covered Persons to raise concerns regarding potential money laundering\nactivity. Reports through the TJX Helpline may be made anonymously (except where prohibited by\nlocal law). For North America, the TJX Helpline number is 1-800-TJX-6488.\nANNUAL REVIEW OF POLICY\nOn an annual basis, TJX shall conduct a review to evaluate its adherence to AML regulatory\nrequirements and the procedures outlined in this policy. The review may be conducted internally,\nprovided that it is not conducted by the CCO or any person involved in the operation of this policy.\nThe annual review will:\n• confirm the integrity and accuracy of TJX’s procedures for reporting large cash transactions;\n• include a review of forms filed with authorities;\n• confirm adherence to TJX’s internal reporting procedures;\n• confirm that Covered Persons were made aware of and received training regarding this policy;\n• confirm that this policy incorporates any revisions required as a result of new legislation or\nregulation; and\n• confirm the integrity and accuracy of TJX’s recordkeeping and retention policies.\nThe results of the annual review shall appear in a summary report, which will be presented to the\nGeneral Counsel. The CCO shall maintain a copy of all annual summary reports for a period of five\nyears.\n2\nJune 2015",

This report can be found in the Store Reports Manager,\nunder Sales Cubes>Daily>Register Reconciliation Report. Store Managers and/or the Manager-on-Duty\n(MOD) should run this report at the beginning of each day, during Cash Office processing, to review all\nprevious-day transaction types and totals, by register.\nFollow these steps to reconcile all Petty Cash transactions.\n1) Complete the standard register reconciliation process for all other tender types, as documented\nin the Cash Office Standard Operating Procedure.\n2) When Petty Cash transactions are found on the reconciliation report, match the values of each\ntransaction with the values printed on any supporting reimbursement documentation and enter\nthose values in the reconciliation spreadsheet.\na) Notify your District Manager and District Loss Prevention Manager if any petty cash\ntransaction listed is not recognized, authorized, or there is no supporting documentation\nfound.\n3) Verify that any DM approval emails and all reimbursement documentation (purchase receipts\nor paid invoices) are printed, intact and filed with the daily cash office paperwork.\n4 | Pag e",

Take out the\namount found on the Register Reconciliation report that you\nentered into the spreadsheet.\n• Using the Cashmaster machine (see the Cashmaster SOP if\nnecessary), begin counting the register till starting with\npennies. When you place the pennies on the HOD, it will tell\nyou how much currency you have. Enter this into a\ncalculator with printing capabilities.(I.e., If you have 25\npennies the Cashmaster will tell you 0.25, which you will\ntype into your calculator).\n• Continue onto nickels, dimes and quarters, ensuring that\nyou type the amount of currency into the calculator each\ntime.\n• When you get to rolls, you can place each roll onto the\nHOD, one at a time until they are all on the HOD. After you\nplace a roll onto the HOD make sure you type into the\ncalculator how much each roll was worth. When all rolls are\non the HOD, you can take them all off. The Cashmaster will\nnext default to bills.\n• Starting with singles, weigh each currency and type the\namount they totaled into the calculator. When you are all\ndone with bills, the Cashmaster will have a long beep when\nyou reach your bank float amount, starting till amount is\n$200.\n• As you count each till enter cash amount for each till in the\nrow titled Cash.\n• If your calculator says you are at the starting till amount\n($200 in this case) hit the star button to print the slip. Make\nsure you sign and date the slip. The slip is then placed into\nthe till next to the\n$20’s.\n3",

You need to add this amount into your calculator slip.\nIt will be your last line and it should now read the starting till\namount.) Hit the star button on the calculator to print the slip.\nMake sure you sign and date the slip. The slip is then placed\ninto the till next to the\n$20’s.\n• If the Cashmaster total is above the float amount (the word\n“Bank” changes to “Total”) and displays a positive amount,\nthen you have an overage. Ensure that you took the right\namount out for the deposit. If you did then you need to remove\nwhatever is over and add it to your deposit pile (i.e. if showing\nan overage of\n$1.50 then take $1.50 from the register till and add it to the\ndeposit pile.) Whatever you take out make sure that you\nsubtract it on the calculator as well (type 1.50 and hit the red\n“- “button in this case). You should now be at your starting till\namount.

As merchandise is flowed to the sales floor,\nAssociates must double-check for tagging accuracy.\nEAS tagging of items other than apparel and shoes will be completed by the bulk / basic sorter.\nThis allows the truck process to continue, without changing the speed of the pacesetter or\napparel processor(s). EAS tags must be placed in arms-reach of the bulk and basic sorter, to\neliminate steps (if processing on the line).\nReview the EAS tagging setup options and determine which fits best for your processing\narea. *It is recommended that stores with smaller backrooms EAS tag items other than\napparel off the line, as shown in option 2*\nOption 1: EAS tagging happens on the processing line for ALL items\nAs pictured on the left; the\nbulk / basic sorter identifies\nand sensors hardlines items.\nThis can be done on the line if\nspace allows, or by placing an\nEAS caddy on the\nmerchandise vehicle. The\npictures represent both\noptions.\nEnsure that your store’s\ncurrent EAS standards are\nposted in a visible location for\nthis processing position.\nProcessing Steps:\n1. As items other than shoes and apparel are removed from boxes, the basic and bulk sorter\nreview for EAS tagging. Apparel will be sent down the line to the apparel processor for\nEAS tagging, and shoes will be processed at the footwear station, off the line.\n2. The bulk and basic sorter EAS sensor identified items, prior to placing them in sorted bins.\n3. The bulk and basic sorter place items in / on the correct merchandise vehicle, tagged\nand ready to be flowed to the sales floor.\n4. As Associates flow merchandise to the sales floor, they are double checking that items are\ntagged to standard.",

    "text": "Introduction\nFast Flow is the Sierra term for processing and flowing merchandise from start to finish.\nThe process is broken down into two main parts: processing merchandise in the\nbackroom and flowing merchandise to the sales floor. The following document\ndescribes both parts in detail. All stores are expected to process trucks and flow\nmerchandise to this standard.\nProcessing and flowing merchandise must be accompanied with the proper plan to\nexecute, through staffing and scheduling. To complete the process efficiently, four\nAssociates, including the Backroom Coordinator should be scheduled at a minimum of\nfour hours, ideally 7am-11am, and taking a break prior to store opening. Additional\nAssociates may be needed to continue flowing merchandise, after the truck has been\nprocessed. Truck processing should take place the day after the truck has arrived. For\nexample, if trucks arrive on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, the processing team\nshould be scheduled Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.\nThe goal is to process and flow merchandise to the sales floor within 24 hours. To flow\nmerchandise to the sales floor efficiently, productivity should be tracked to ensure the\nprocess stays on target. While processing, the cartons per hour goal is 7.0 and\nshould be achieved through proper setup of the backroom. While flowing merchandise\nto the sales floor, each vehicle that holds merchandise has a standard time to complete,\ne.g., a z-rack should be flowed to the department in approximately 20 minutes. It is\nimportant that Associates are aware of the productivity standards and are coached and\ntrained accordingly. Each Associate should keep track of their processing time.\nJob aids for equipment use, processing positions, and EAS standards should be placed\nin visible locations in the backroom.\n2",

This will help to organize and\nexpedite the everyday / programmed single queue items and prevents damages.\n• Place like items in totes on the same dolly for easy replenishment\n• For easy identification and replenishment, label the totes accordingly based on\nthe programmed items, listed above.\nRemember that certain items have a specific placement within the queue. Tech, and\nWellness should always be positioned on the outside of the queue facing the main\nracetrack. Seasonal items should be placed in the first two or three positions within the\nqueue, so they are most visible and will sell relatively quickly.\nKey Components of the Queue\nKey elements to the success of the queue, starts with strategic scheduling. Associates\nshould be scheduled accordingly to ensure merchandise is prioritized in the queue line.\nThe Coordinator should communicate to the MOD if / when backup is needed to\ncontinue queue line merchandising. The Coordinator or front-end Associate should\ncommunicate their merchandising plan to the team. Ensure totes of queue line\nmerchandise are not left out in the aisle.\n24",

    "text": "Tracking Tools\nTracking the efficiency and continued progress of processing goods is a critical\ncomponent of running a successful store.\nUnits and cartons processed per hour is a tool that can help to identify areas of\nopportunity within the backroom. Some opportunities may include training / coaching of\nAssociates, providing direction on merchandising, and prioritizing certain goods to the\nsales floor depending on space.\nCPH Calculation (Input on the Summit through Retail Trackers)\nCartons per hour (CPH) can be calculated based on the number of pallets that were\nprocessed, how many total hours were spent processing, and the standard of 25\ncartons per pallet. For example, if 8 pallets were processed in 16 hours total time (4\nAssociates processing for 4 hours each), the cartons per hour (CPH) would be 12.5.\nTime is contributed from each hourly Associate, actively processing. To get an accurate\nCPH, make sure Associates subtract time spent on breaks.\nFast Flow Calculator (Saved to shared store folder / backroom computer desktop)\nThe Fast Flow Calculator is a store facing tool used to track flowing and CPH. The\ncalculator should be saved to a shared store folder or desktop on the backroom\ncomputer. This excel document can be found on the Summit within the Fast Flow\nFolder.\nDirections:\n1. Save the calculator to your computer, or a shared folder that your store leaders can access\n2. Navigate to the tab for the current week\n3. Backroom Processing\na. Enter the # of Pallets being processed on the specific day, along with the Schedule\nProcessing Hours, total # of Scheduled Associates to work those hours, as well as the\nActual Processing Hours used\nb. At the end of the week, enter any unprocessed Pallets Carrying Over into the next week.\nThese will be automatically added to the following Sunday, but can be allocated to another\nday as appropriate by store\nc. The Actual CPH metric will calculate, and this will be added to the Tracker on the\nSummit\nd. Store leaders can also use this calculator to understand if the actual time it took to\nprocess the pallets was more/less than what was scheduled for future use\n4. Flow to Floor\na. Enter the total # of Scheduled Hours per day to flow merchandise to the floor, as well as the\ntotal # of Scheduled Associates to work those hours.

The Fast Flow process can be validated by utilizing the\ntools on the following pages. Once the process can be validated to completion, it\nshould be routinely validated, to ensure everything stays on track and efficiency is\nmaximized.\nHow will you make sure the program sticks?\n• Train all Associates utilizing best practices\n• Observe and coach in the moment, to guide and recognize Associate performance\n• Use the tracking tools to monitor processing and flowing of goods, as needed\n• Celebrate improvements and recognize Associates with S.O.A.R cards\n• Make it fun! Create contests for the best CPH, flowing goods to the floor, or the best\nfeature. Having fun and keeping your Associates engaged will drive great results\nValidation Instructions:\nTo ensure store teams are set for success in the backroom, it is necessary to validate\nthe Fast Flow process from start to finish. It is important that each area is assessed and\nonly validated to completion. If an area cannot yet be validated, it should be addressed\nand fixed immediately.\nFast Flow Validation should be conducted first as a store self-assessment, with the\nOperations ASM and Store Manager, and after successful self-validation, the Store\nManager must validate the process in partnership with their District Manager. The Fast\nFlow SOP should be used to aid the validation process to ensure setup and flow are set\nto standard / reset as needed.\nPrint the following validation pages and utilize the space between each validation point\nto make note of areas to recognize or improve. Do not check off a validation point until\nit is to standard. Completed validation pages should be retained for 6 months in the\nfiling cabinet by the backroom computer.\nAreas to validate:\n• Backroom Layout and Equipment\n• Truck Team – roles and responsibilities\n• Leadership Team – roles and responsibilities\n• Receiving and Productivity Tracking\n• Flowing Merchandise\n27",

The Fast Flow process can be validated by utilizing the\ntools on the following pages. Once the process can be validated to completion, it\nshould be routinely validated, to ensure everything stays on track and efficiency is\nmaximized.\nHow will you make sure the program sticks?\n• Train all Associates utilizing best practices\n• Observe and coach in the moment, to guide and recognize Associate performance\n• Use the tracking tools to monitor processing and flowing of goods, as needed\n• Celebrate improvements and recognize Associates with S.O.A.R cards\n• Make it fun! Create contests for the best CPH, flowing goods to the floor, or the best\nfeature. Having fun and keeping your Associates engaged will drive great results\nValidation Instructions:\nTo ensure store teams are set for success in the backroom, it is necessary to validate\nthe Fast Flow process from start to finish. It is important that each area is assessed and\nonly validated to completion. If an area cannot yet be validated, it should be addressed\nand fixed immediately.\nFast Flow Validation should be conducted first as a store self-assessment, with the\nOperations ASM and Store Manager, and after successful self-validation, the Store\nManager must validate the process in partnership with their District Manager. The Fast\nFlow SOP should be used to aid the validation process to ensure setup and flow are set\nto standard / reset as needed.\nPrint the following validation pages and utilize the space between each validation point\nto make note of areas to recognize or improve. Do not check off a validation point until\nit is to standard. Completed validation pages should be retained for 6 months in the\nfiling cabinet by the backroom computer.\nAreas to validate:\n• Backroom Layout and Equipment\n• Truck Team – roles and responsibilities\n• Leadership Team – roles and responsibilities\n• Receiving and Productivity Tracking\n• Flowing Merchandise",

Follow the Damage Center Planogram & Signage guide for all setup instructions.\nb) Ensure that both Damage Centers are clearly signed and remain clean, neat and organized. These spaces must\nnever block safety paths or points of egress.\n2) Set Expectations\na) Based on your damages volume, set processing workload expectations with all store leaders. All damaged\nmerchandise categories must be fully processed on a weekly basis, at a minimum. All processing should be\ncompleted within no less than 3 weekdays from the end of each fiscal month.\nb) Ensure that only trained Managers or Coordinators are completing Store Generated Markdowns and Mark out of\nStock (MOOS) functions.\nc) Ensure that all associates are trained and adhering to merchandise damage standards, including knowing the\nlocation of both Damage Centers and how to complete a Damage Tag.\n3) Follow Standards\na) Management discretion will often be used to support the proper disposition of damaged or unsellable merchandise.\nMerchandise may be processed in one of four categories:\n1) Mark out of Stock: An item is unsalable in current condition, cannot be made salable, or is unsafe to sell\nand must be removed from sales floor, marked out of stock and destroyed\n2) Store Generated Markdown: An item is salable in current condition and requires a discounted price to\nensure optimal selloff\n3) Merchandise Salvage: An item that has resale value and is in safe, salable condition but deemed\nunsalable by TJX and is sent to a salvage company\n4) Merchandise Mis-mate: An item sold as a multi-piece unit that is found to be missing one or multiple\npieces and is salable, requiring a discounted price to ensure optimal selloff\nb) Dispose of damaged, unsalable merchandise in accordance with TJX hazardous/regulated waste guidelines, local\nrecycling laws, and as guided in the Merchandise Damage Program SOP, under the Mark out of Stock section.\nCOMPLIANCE & PREVENTION EXPECTATIONS\nStores' adherence to merchandise damage processes will be monitored and assessed by their DM and/or DLPM during both\nregularly scheduled and unannounced visitation. Store management is responsible for ensuring that proper staffing\nand workload planning considerations are made to meet or exceed the process standards outlined in the Merchandise\nDamage Program SOP.\nDamage Prevention is a key element in driving profitable sales. All Associates play a role in processing, stocking, handling\nand recovering all merchandise with care and safety per Company guidelines. Store Management should partner with their DM\nto provide early reporting and clear documentation of any in-transit or vendor-based damage trends.\nRev. 07.2024 Page 1",

    "text": "SOP – Merchandise Damage\n1. PURPOSE\nThe purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure is to provide stores with the\nnecessary information and detailed instruction on how to plan and execute merchandise\ndamage processes. The successful completion of these processes is critical to drive\nprofit, support customer loyalty, maintain proper merchandise presentation, and keep an\naccurate inventory.\n2. GENERAL INFORMATION\nMerchandise damages can come from multiple sources and can cost the company\nmillions of dollars each year. They influence total store profit, shortage and the\ncustomer experience. There are many causes of damage, including but not limited to:\n- Warehouse & Transit originated damage due to handling and movement\nbetween distribution centers and stores\n- Vendor originated damage concealed within merchandise packaging\n- Store originated damage due to mishandling or salesfloor accidents\n- Customer originated damage from purchases and returns\nWhen merchandise becomes damaged or otherwise unsellable in current condition, a\ndecision must be made to process this merchandise in the best manner to serve our\nbusiness and/or customer. There are four processing categories: Mark out of Stock\n(MOOS), commonly referred to as ‘Destroy’, Store Generated Markdowns (SGM),\nMerchandise Salvage, and Merchandise Mis-mates. Once a process is chosen,\nbased on the merchandise condition, stores must follow the specific process steps\noutlined in this document and validate final placement. Management is solely\nresponsible for executing all damages processes and ensuring that all processes are\nbeing enforced correctly.\n3. SYSTEMS\nAll damage functions are completed using the Order Management System (OMS)\napplication, accessible on all back-office PC’s. Each member of management who will\nprocess damages must be set up in OMS User Management with the appropriate\naccess level. Management will logon to the application with their Associate Identification\nNumber (AIN). This section will cover all specific damages equipment and application\ninformation.\n1",

    "text": "SOP – Merchandise Damage\nEquipment\nThe equipment that may be required to complete merchandise damage processes\nincludes an OMS-enabled computer with attached barcode scanner and a mobile or\ndesktop tag printer with corresponding merchandise tags.\nPrinters\nDamaged merchandise may require a re-printed or new price tag to be processed. The\ncurrent Sierra mobile tag printer is the Zebra ZQ-series model. This device can print all\nmerchandise sticky tags, often referred to as ‘gum tags’. The current Sierra hang tag\nprinter is the Zebra ZT-series model, located at both the front-end register area and the\nback-end receiving area. This device can print all merchandise hang tags, often referred\nto as ‘hard tags’.\nLabels\nThe labels used for pricing store merchandise are color-coordinated and specifically\ndesigned for merchandise pricing only. As previously indicated, these labels are often\nreferred to as gum tags. All label stock is searchable and orderable through the existing\nstores supply ordering process. Store Management is responsible for ordering the\nproper models and quantities of labels.\nThe gum tags used for merchandise pricing have the following color standards:\n· RED – standard markdown ‘clearance’ price changes\n· YELLOW – end-of-season markdown ‘clearance’ price changes\n· WHITE – regular-price merchandise that cannot support a hangtag\nApplication\nTo access the OMS application, Associates must logon to OMS from any compatible\nstore computer using their Associate Identification Number (AIN). Follow these steps in\nOMS to successfully access the appropriate damages functions.\nOMS Print Retail Tags (printing of regular & clearance tags, conducting Store\nGenerated Markdowns)\nUpon successful OMS logon, Managers will navigate to the Print Retail Tags function\nfollowing these steps:\n1) At the OMS main screen, select the Transaction menu, then select Sales\nOrder Processing, then select Print Retail Tags.\n2",

DAMAGE PLANNING\nTo ensure optimal sales, merchandise flow, inventory accuracy and timeliness, stores\nare provided with several resources to properly plan their damages processes.\nPlanning Process\nStore Management is responsible for creating the plan to conduct weekly processing of\ndamages. The following steps are key to the successful planning and completion of\ndamages:\n1) Create & Maintain the Space – Damage Center\na) Identify an easily accessible 4’ wall location in the backroom and setup a\n‘damage center’ for damaged merchandise to be collected and processed. Use\nthe Damage Center Planogram as the setup standard for this location.\nb) Identify an easily accessible and customer-concealed location at the front-end\nand setup an additional damages collection area for Associates to securely place\nfound and received damaged merchandise. The majority use of this area will be\nfor customer returns. Again, use the Damage Center Planogram as the setup\nstandard for this location.\nc) Ensure that both damages locations are clearly signed and kept clear of all\nobstructions or non-damaged merchandise. These spaces should be a\npermanent home for all damaged merchandise processing. The Damage Center\nsignage kit must be used to support consistent signing.\n3",

All damaged or mis-mate merchandise must be assessed as\nbeing in one of two different selling categories:\n• SALABLE – merchandise is safe, presentable, and operationally intact (can still\nbe of use as-is); can be purchased by customers, sold at full-price or sold at a\ndiscount.\n• UNSALABLE – merchandise is unsafe, unsanitary, or no longer meets the\nquality, image or BFPQ standards of the company; must be marked out of stock\nand either sent to salvage or destroyed.\nBased on the assessed condition and selling category, store management is\nresponsible for processing all damaged merchandise in a timely manner, based on one\nof the four processing categories highlighted in this document.\nDamaged Merchandise Collection and Tagging\nCollection – Damage Center\nThere must be clearly designated areas in the store for a Damage Center, both at the\nfront-end and in the backroom. The Damage Center is meant to temporarily store\nmerchandise that has been deemed damaged or mis-mated by any Associate or\nManager. Please refer to the Damage Center Planogram for more information.\nThe front-end Damage Center provides a front-of-store storage space for both\ndamaged and mis-mate merchandise. This center is predominantly meant to collect\ndamages and mis-mates from customer purchases and returns, as well as any\ndamages found near the front-end. It is the responsibility of management to ensure that\nthis Damage Center is cleared daily (or more frequently, as needed), with all damages\nand mis-mates transferred to the backroom Damage Center for future processing.\nThe backroom Damage Center provides a centralized storage and processing space\nfor both damaged and mis-mate merchandise. The center is meant to collect ALL store\ndamages and mis-mates from all areas of the salesfloor, processing areas and transfers\nfrom the front-end Damage Center. It is the responsibility of management to ensure that\nthis Damage Center is processed and cleared weekly, at a minimum (or more\nfrequently, as needed).\n5",

The Merchandise Damage Tag\ntemplate can be found on The Summit, under Store Operations>Merchandise Damage\nProgram. Merchandise Damage Tags are to be printed and made available, in\nappropriate quantities, at both store Damage Centers. There are three main sections of\nthe Damage Tag:\n1) Damage Details – complete this section (one-side) if the merchandise is\nidentified as being damaged, be it salable or unsalable. Tag fields include date of\ndamage, description of damage, and origin of damage. All broken-glass or\nhazardous damages should immediately be brought to the attention of a\nmanager and processed accordingly.\n2) Salvage Status – check the ‘Salvage Item’ yes/no box if the merchandise is\ndamaged and deemed as salvageable.\n3) Mis-Mate Details – complete this section (one-side) if the merchandise is\nidentified as a mis-mate and place the item/s in the mis-mate bin. Tag fields\ninclude date mis-mate was found, description of missing piece/s, and origin of\nmis-mate.\nAll Merchandise Damage Tag fields must be filled-in legibly, using a pen or pencil and\nmust be securely attached to each item of merchandise that is damaged. Use of tape,\nrubber bands, or price tag fasteners are recommended for attaching Merchandise\nDamage Tags.\n5a. STORE GENERATED MARKDOWNS\nAll damaged merchandise that is deemed to be in salable condition but requires a\ndiscounted price (markdown) for optimal sell-off must receive a Store Generated\nMarkdown, or SGM. Only store management is entrusted with the responsibility and\nauthority to make manual markdown decisions within stated guidelines.\nAssessing Damage for Appropriate Markdown\nThe five categories below provide further detail to assist in making markdown decisions.\n1. Repairable (no markdown) – minimal cosmetic scratches, dings, loose parts.\nIf these types of damages can be repaired and restored to ‘like new’ condition,\nthey should not be marked down and can be sold at full/current price.\n6",

Major – Very noticeable cosmetic damage or most hardware missing (with it\nstill being safe to sell) should be marked down to 50% off the current retail.\nPlease use discretion when assessing major damage to ensure it is still salable.\n5. Un-salable – Merchandise that is severely damaged, distressed, or\nconsidered unsafe and does not fit into any of the first four damage categories\nshould be deemed unsalable and unsuitable for presentation to the customers\nand should be marked out of stock and salvaged or destroyed at store level.\nDue to the various types of merchandise in the stores, it is impossible to establish\nmarkdown guidelines to cover all situations. However, in addition to the guidance\nabove, the Damages Execution Planner provides detailed markdown guidance by\ndepartment, as well as a price matrix to easily determine ‘was/is’ pricing on any item.\nOrigin & Reason of SGM\nAs previously stated, merchandise damage can come from multiple sources, be it from\nthe receiving process, within the store or from our customers. In addition to assessing\nthe current condition and salability of an item, store management is responsible for\ncapturing the known origin and reason for the damage. This step is complete as part of\nthe SGM ticket creation, as detailed below. The reasons for damage are referred to as\ndamage codes and are listed as follows:\nOrigin Codes Reason Codes\nOFF truck/transit DAMAGED salable item with damage,\nTRUCK damage SALABLE discounted\nCUSTOMER customer return CORP Home Office directed price\ndamage DIRECTED change\nIN-STORE in-store based MISMATE salable item missing\ndamage piece/s, discounted\nMISSED Salable seasonal/aged\nMARKDOWN item, discounted\nMGR Customer Satisfaction or\nDISCRECTION other reason\n7",

The item will be marked out of stock and removed from\ninventory upon confirmation.\n6) If any scanned item has a current on-hand system quantity of zero or less\n(negative inventory), the item’s on-hand quantity will continue to be reduced\naccurately as negative inventory.\n7) Upon completing all MOOS Salvage scanning, all Sierra hangtags must be\nremoved from the merchandise before being boxed for shipment. If the\nproduct has a Sierra sticky tag, please cross out the UPC with a black\npermanent marker.\n8) Vendor ticketing must remain intact on all items before being boxed for\nshipment.

Only\nuse empty truck cartons to ship salvages, due to carton strength and consistency. Only\nfull cartons may be shipped to the salvage company. Hold partial cartons and fill for the\nnext shipment. Salvage cartons may contain a mix of apparel and hardlines items.\nWrite your store number on the prepaid salvage company barcoded shipping label (in\nthis format: Sierra 0###) and affix one label to each salvage carton. For carton pick-up,\ncall FedEx at 1-800-463-3339.

A Mis-mate is any multi-piece merchandise with one or more pieces of a\nset are missing or have mismatched sizes. (e.g. A 2-piece swimwear set is missing the\nbottom or top.)\nAs identified in the Damage Center Planogram, there must be designated area in the\nDamage Center, both at the front-end and the backroom, to house mis-mate\nmerchandise to be processed.

All mis-mate merchandise that is deemed unsalable, based on\nthe guidelines in the Mark Out of Stock section of this document, should be moved to\nthe damages bin for future MOOS processing.\nMis-mate Merchandise Discovery & Hold\nWhen apparel, hardlines, and footwear mis-mates are found on the sale floor or off the\ntruck, associates and management should immediately check the following areas for the\nmissing items:\n● Shipment Cartons – if the mis-mate is found during the processing of a store\nshipment, hold the item/s in the mis-mate holding area until the total shipment has been\nprocessed.\n● Fitting Rooms – check open Fitting Rooms and the Fitting Room Recovery (‘Go-\nBack’) Rack for any corresponding pieces\n● Sales Floor – check the parent department to look for corresponding pieces or a\nmatching pair. As well, check clearance fixtures to see if the missing item had been\npreviously found and marked down.\n● Mis-mate holding area (Damage Center) – check to see if the item found is part of a\npreviously identified mis-mate.\nAfter all areas have been checked and the missing piece/s cannot be found, the\nfollowing steps are to be immediately taken to hold the merchandise for potential\nmatching:\nFootwear: Each mis-mate shoe must have a Merchandise Damage Tag attached, with\nthe Mis-Mate section filled-out.

Once a Ship-to-Store order has left the Fulfillment\nCenter (FCDC), it should arrive at its designated store within 7-15 days. Read more\nabout the program here.\nCUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS\nAn automated email system sends STS order notifications to our customers with the\nfollowing cadence:\n1. Order Confirmation – sent to the customer as soon as their web-order has been\nsuccessfully charged and all merchandise within the order is confirmed available\nfor processing.\n2. Order Arrival – sent to the customer once their order is ready for pickup in their\nselected store location.

    "text": "Markdown Execution Planner\nMARKDOWN PLANNING\n1) Create the Plan\na) Identify markdown dates and cycle/s by utilizing the Store Markdown Calendar.\nb) At least one week in advance of the next markdown file, prepare and assign the markdown scanning ‘flow’ based on\nthe cycle/s to be scanned and the current merchandise presentation flow. Always plan to scan the store front-to-\nback. Stores cannot scan their markdowns based on high-to-low unit ownership by department, random selection, or\npersonal management preference.\nc) All markdown scanning must begin on the date that's indicated on the Store Markdown Calendar, no\nexceptions. Please refer to this calendar for the most up-to-date scan-start direction. Sub files are always scanned the\nday prior to an initial file and must be completed within the same day. All initial file scanning should be planned to\nbe completed within no more than 5 weekdays from the date the file begins.\nd) Ensure that all markdown equipment is in good working order, fully charged and accessible to use. Ensure appropriate\nsupplies are available for all scanning associates.\n2) Staff the Plan\na) Based on upcoming markdown dates and cycle/s, create a labor plan and schedule associates and management\naccordingly to support efficient markdown execution. In UKG Pro, use the Shift Transfer function to identify specific\nassociate shifts for markdown scanning execution.\nb) Markdowns are to be performed by a dedicated team of no fewer than two associates. Leaders should schedule with\nthe goal of utilizing all mobile scanners.\nc) Plan to spread markdown execution across an appropriate number of days to meet and exceed compliance\nexpectations, based on number of departments to be scanned, markdown file size and anticipated customer traffic/\nsales. Avoid high-traffic periods of the day or busy weekends. Stores should not plan any markdown scanning\nactivity on weekend days, unless being conducted prior to store opening.\nd) Markdown shifts should always be planned to begin prior to store opening. Maintain a focus on balancing markdown\nworkload with other store workload needs. Stores with competing workload priorities must ensure that\nmarkdowns remain a consistent priority in tandem with truck processing and sales floor merchandising.\n3) Communicate the Plan\na) Store Management must communicate the markdown plan to all other members of management as soon as planning\nhas completed. MOD's will communicate the markdown strategy to the scheduled markdown team during each day of\nscanning.\nb) As scanning is completed and validated across departments and categories, the MOD will update the Markdown\nTracker with all areas that have been scanned and the completion rate for each department.\nRev. 10.2024 Page 1",

    "text": "Markdown Execution Planner\nCOMPLIANCE EXPECTATIONS\nStores are measured on their markdown scanning results and performance by day, otherwise known as markdown\ncompliance. When planning markdowns, stores are to ensure that proper staffing, equipment, and workload considerations are\nmade to meet or exceed the following compliance expectations:\nAll stores are expected to achieve a minimum of a 70% markdown compliance rate. The markdown compliance rate is\nmeasured as the total number of markdown-eligible items in an active cycle divided by the number of actual marked items\n(items that have been scanned and tagged as a markdown), multiplied by 100.\nSCANNING PROCESS STEPS\n1) Pre-Scanning Recovery - Plan and conduct a detailed recovery (sizing and reticketing) the day before the markdown cycle.\n2) Returns & Holds - Returned merchandise or released holds must be scanned for markdowns before returning to the floor.\n3) Department/Scan Prioritization - Always start scanning by following the merchandise presentation flow to match the cycle/\ns being scanned, front-of-store to back-of-store, left-to-right, outer pads to inner pads, from wall to floor to feature. If\nscanning all cycles in the same file, always start with apparel and end with hardlines. Scan each department to completion\nas a team, ensuring not to forget features, display shelves with live merchandise, and mannequins or busts.\n4) Label Placement - As each markdown label prints, immediately align & affix the label to either completely cover an existing\nregular-price or clearance gum tag or cover the lowest section of a hang tag without concealing the regular price.\n5) Merchandise Movement - After scanning is completed in a department and before moving on to the next, complete the\nmovement and re-merchandising of all newly marked down merchandise to the appropriate clearance selling areas.\n6) Tagging Issues & Damage - Collect and hold all merchandise that is damaged or missing a tag until the scan of the\ndepartment is complete. Upon completion, ensure tags are made or merchandise is moved to the damage center.\n7) Recovery - Maintain a continual focus on total store recovery standards throughout the markdown scanning process.\n8) Unfound Item Reconciliation - After the store has been fully scanned, review the Store Ops Price Change Report to\nanalyze any outstanding items and attempt to scan any items that may have been missed.\nRev. 10.2024 Page 2",

Please ensure the following\nresponsibilities are met as you go through the markdown process:\n• Ensure markdown equipment remains with you and is never left unattended\n• Keep customer service top of mind\n• Communicate with Associate team and MOD on scanning and remerchandising\nprogress\nLeader Responsibilities:\nStore management is responsible for creating the markdown plan for each file, staffing the\nplan to ensure proper coverage for timely completion, and communicating the plan to all\nassigned Associates. In addition, MOD's should play an active role in markdown\ncompletion, checking-in with Associates on scanning progress throughout the day and\nensuring that all appropriate fixtures and units are being scanned. Scanning participation\nmay be required of an MOD, based on staffing and business needs.\nEquipment Device Logon & Use\nScanner\n1. Logon to the scanner using the passcode: 5025\n2. Tap the OMS Mobile icon and enter/scan your AIN, then tap Login\n3. Select your printer from the printer listing\n4. Tap the Item Code box to ensure the merchandise you scan will be captured Printer\nPrinter\n1. Load printer with the proper color labels (red = regular markdown, yellow = seasonal\nmarkdown)\n2.

Place the clearance label over the previous bar code, while still showcasing the\noriginal ticket price to the customer.\n5. Remove all labeled clearance merchandise from the fixture/shelf and place it on\nyour markdown carriage/rack/tank. These items must be re-merchandised into\ndesignated clearance areas. Remember to never keep clearance merchandise in\nwith regular-priced items.\n6. If an item is missing a tag, you cannot scan an item or you find a damaged item,\nremove it from the fixture/shelf and place it in a damages/re-tagging area.\nRemember to designate a space on you carriage/rack/tank for these items as\nyou scan through the department.\n7. Always scan for markdowns first from the wall, then scan all racks/gondolas,\nthen scan all features, by category, to ensure completion of each department\nbefore moving on to the next.

Once logged on,\nManagers will access via the Reports Manager link on the homepage of The\nSummit (click here to access).\nStep 2: Open/Logon to Reports Manager and Select Report\nOnce the Reports Manager Homepage loads, scroll and select the ‘Retail Cubes’\nlink, then select ‘Inventory Control’, then select the ‘Markdown Scans Productivity\nDetail Report. The report page will load.\nStep 3: Select Report Parameters and Run Report\nFrom the report page, Managers will have several required search fields\n(‘parameters’) to complete before the report can run successfully. Each field will\nhave drop-down options from which to select. Managers will enter the information\nand select the options that correspond to their specific markdown file. Once all\ninformation and options are entered, click the ‘View Report’ button to run the\nreport. Please note that, depending on each store’s network connection, the\nreport run process could take up to 5 minutes to complete before the report will\nload.\nThe following parameters must be completed:\n· Start Date and End Date - select the start and end dates that match the\nrange of your markdown file/s. These dates can be verified using the\nSierra Stores Markdown Calendar. Please refer to Section 4 for more\ninformation.\n· Store – select the appropriate store location\n· Dept – unless seeking to view only one specific department, Managers\nshould select ‘ALL’ from the drop-down menu\nStep 4: View and Interpret Report Results\nOnce all report parameters are selected and the report\n1.2 Report Export Options\nloads, Managers will be able to view, filter and interpret\nthe content within the report. Please note that the\ninformation within the report does NOT reflect live results\nof an active store scan. All results are shown with a 24-\nhour delay. For example, if a manager runs this report in\nthe afternoon of Wednesday, while markdown scanning\nis happening, the results shown will only reflect the\nscanning activity up to the prior Tuesday afternoon (24-\nhours ago). The Markdown Scans Productivity Detail\nreport can be saved and downloaded into several\ndifferent formats for easier viewing, editing, and\narchiving. The save function can be accessed by selecting the disk icon from the\ntop navigation menu then selecting the export file type of your choice. For best\nresults, it is recommended to export and save the report as an ‘XML file with\nreport data’. Please refer to image 1.2.\n4 | Page",

    "text": "SOP – Store Markdowns\nPURPOSE\nThis Standard Operating Procedure provides the Sierra stores organization with the\nnecessary information and detailed instructions on how to plan and execute the Store\nMarkdowns process. Successfully completing store markdowns is critical to driving\nsales, customer service and loyalty, merchandise presentation, inventory accuracy, and\nstore profit.\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nThe Sierra buying team works with merchandise planning and digital finance to select\nmerchandise that will receive a selling price reduction, otherwise known as a markdown.\nAll merchandise selected for a markdown is known as ‘clearance merchandise’.\nMarkdowns are planned at the department and unit (‘style-code’) level and are selected\non several factors, including:\n- Turnover/Age – Primary reason; merchandise that has not sold at regular price\nafter an acceptable period will be reduced to accelerate selloff.\n- End of Season – Secondary reason; merchandise bought for a particular\nseason or holiday that has exceeded its seasonality and is no longer on-trend or\nrelevant to the customer’s expectations.\n- Low Quantities – Merchandise that has low remaining on-hand quantities\nacross the chain and is selected to clear the remaining stock\n- Market Competition – As market trends and pricing fluctuate, some\nmerchandise may be selected for price reduction to stimulate selloff and offer the\ncustomer a more competitive value.\nThe selected style-codes are bundled into a Markdown File, which is then downloaded\nto stores on a scheduled basis. The Store Markdown Calendar provides stores with a\nmonthly schedule of all markdown file dates within each season. Occasionally,\nmarkdown files may be added to the schedule or paused/canceled to support sales\ntrends or inventory levels.\nOnce a markdown file is downloaded to the store, it is ready for the store team to begin\nscanning. This involves physically scanning and marking merchandise with special price\ntags that advertise a reduced price. Store management is responsible for ensuring that\nthese markdown files are started and completed on time and that all departments and\nmerchandise included in the markdown file have been scanned.\n1",

This section will cover all information on markdown systems.\nEquipment\nThe equipment required to complete a markdown file includes a mobile scanning device\n(‘mobile scanner’), mobile tag printing device (‘mobile printer’), ring scanner, and\nmerchandise labels (‘gum tags’).\nWhile not in use, all markdown equipment, including mobile scanners, mobile printers\n(and batteries), and ring scanners, are to be stored on their designated docking stations\nfor proper charging and should be kept in a secured, back-office location. When\nassociates aren’t actively using this equipment, they must always log out of their mobile\nscanners and power down their mobile printers. Equipment cannot be left unattended\non the sales floor while the store is open and must be moved to one of the following\nsecure locations when called to a register, walking away to support a customer, or\ntaking a rest period:\n- Secured back-office docking station\n- Behind the front-end area, out of customer reach\n- Backroom/processing area\nMobile Scanner\nThe current model mobile scanner is the Zebra TC52 series. This device provides\naccess to the OMS Sierra Store App, which hosts all in-store mobile applications.\nInformation on how to access and navigate the mobile scanner is listed in the\nApplication section below.\nMobile Printer\nThe current model mobile printer is the Zebra ZQ620 series. This device allows for the\nloading and printing of merchandise price labels, often called ‘tags’. These printers\nutilize a removable power pack (‘battery’).\nRing Scanner\nThe current model ring scanner is the Zebra RS5100 series. This device is meant to be\npaired with a scanner for convenient, hands-free, finger-mounted scanning of\nmerchandise tags. The Ring Scanner SOP documents information on how to pair and\noperate the ring scanner.\n2",

All tag stock can be ordered\nthrough the existing store supply ordering process. Store Management is responsible\nfor ordering the proper quantities of each tag. Like markdown equipment, tag stock is to\nbe kept in a designated, secured storage location when not in use and cannot be left\nunattended on the sales floor.\nApplication\nMarkdown scanning is completed using the Order Management System (OMS) mobile\napplication, known as the Sierra Store App. All associates scanning markdowns must\nfirst be set up in OMS User Management with the appropriate access level. Once set\nup, follow the steps below to successfully log on to the mobile scanner, access the\nSierra Store App, log on to the Retail Cadence app, select a printer, and pair a ring\nscanner.\nStep 1: Mobile Scanner Device Logon\nWhen the scanner is powered on and lifted from the charging dock or when the\npower button is pressed to exit sleep mode, a password will be required to unlock\nthe device.\n1) Tap and hold the lock icon on the bottom of the device screen while\nswiping up to access the password entry screen.\n2) Once on the entry screen, enter password 5025 (for all store locations)\nand tap the checkmark button.\nStep 2: Sierra Store App Logon and Navigation\nUpon successful device login, associates must select the Sierra Store App from\nthe launch menu and navigate to the proper store application.\n1) After selecting the Sierra Store App, tap the three lines in the top left\ncorner of the screen to open the application menu and select the Retail\nCadence option.\n3",

Pressing and holding the device power button on the mobile printer and ring\nscanner will shut the device down. Press the power button once more to power it back\non. If a device issue continues, open a new technology incident via ServiceNow.\nSTORE MARKDOWNS REPORTING\nAs markdowns are being scanned, Store Management must continually review the\nprogress of the markdown file to ensure all intended merchandise and markdown\ndepartments are being scanned. Each markdown file is monitored for scanning progress\nby the merchant, store operations, and field leadership teams. Once scanning is\ncompleted for each markdown file, field leadership will review the final markdown\ncapture rate, otherwise known as markdown compliance. This is measured as a\npercentage of the total number of available markdown units in the file, by store, divided\nby the total number of scanned markdown units at the time of completion.\nThe Store Ops Price Change Report is the primary report for store management to\naccess up-to-date markdown file statistics and scanning progress. Store Managers\nand/or the Manager-on-Duty (MOD) should run this report at the end of each day’s\nmarkdown scanning execution to gauge progress and know how many pieces of\nmerchandise remain outstanding, by department.\nFollow these steps to access and run the Store Ops Price Change Report.\n4",

To support the planning process, several resources and process steps are\nlisted below. Before creating a plan, keep in mind the following markdown file\nstandards.\n- The size of each store’s markdown file will vary based on the time of year, current\nstore inventory levels, future orders, and department and style selling performance.\n- there are two file types that separate markdowns by the status of the merchandise\nbeing marked down:\n- Initial - Often referred to as ‘initials’, this file type includes all merchandise currently\nbeing sold at regular price (any price ending in ‘.99’)\n- Sub - Short for subsequent and often referred to as ‘subs’, this file type includes all\nmerchandise currently being sold at an existing clearance price (any price ending in\n‘.00’)\n- In tandem with file types, markdown files are separated into three processing\ncategories, otherwise known as ‘cycles’. These cycles balance the load of merchandise,\ndepartments, and categories to be marked down against the date, day, and week of\ntheir execution. The following cycles are created for Sierra Stores:\n- Cycle All, Initial, and/or Sub – This cycle includes all merchandise categories and\ndepartments within the store. It may be planned as separate files (initials only, subs only)\nor combined files (all initials and subs).\n- Cycle 1, Initial and/or Sub - This cycle includes all soft-line merchandise categories\nand departments within the store and may be planned as separate files (initials only,\n6",

The calendar is posted to the\nSierra SharePoint site, otherwise known as ‘The Summit’. The purpose of this calendar\nis to provide store Management with a clear understanding of all planned markdown\nfiles for each fiscal season, listed by start day/s, fiscal weeks, and fiscal months. The\ncalendar also provides a view of all markdown start date changes versus the original\noperating plan (OP), last year’s markdown dates (LY) and the markdown date of the\nyear prior (LLY).\nStore Ops Price Change Report – As previously stated, this report is the primary\nsource for store Leaders to access up-to-date markdown file statistics and scanning\nprogress. Store management should run this report at the end of each day’s markdown\nscanning execution to gauge progress and know how many pieces of merchandise\nremain to be marked down by department.\nMarkdown Execution Planner – A reference tool that stores can use to refer to critical\nmarkdown planning and execution guidelines and track scanning progress by\ndepartment. The planner can be found on The Summit, under Operations>Store\nMarkdowns Program.\nLeaders Guide - A reference tool that Store & District Management can use to validate\nkey success measures of the Stoer Markdowns Program, including several suggested\nin-store observations and validation questions.

The markdown plan should be created with the\nguidance of the planning resources listed above and through the following steps:\n1) Create the Plan\na) Identify markdown dates and cycle/s by utilizing the Store Markdown\nCalendar. Note that this calendar is subject to change and Store Operations will\ncommunicate all changes. Please ensure you are viewing the most up-to-date\nversion.\nb) Prepare and assign the markdown scanning ‘flow’ based on the cycle/s to be\nscanned and the current merchandise presentation flow. Always plan to scan\nthe store front-to-back. Stores must never scan their markdowns based on\nhigh-to-low unit ownership by department, random selection, or personal\nmanagement preference.\nc) All markdown scanning must begin on the date that’s indicated on the\nStore Markdown Calendar, no exceptions. Sub files are always scanned the\nday prior to an initial file and must be completed within the same day. All initial\nfile scanning should be planned to be completed within no more than 5 weekdays\nfrom the date the file begins.\nd) Ensure that all markdown equipment is in good working order, fully charged,\nand accessible. Ensure appropriate supplies are available for all scanning\nassociates.\n2) Staff the Plan\na) Markdowns are to be performed by a dedicated markdown team and leaders\nshould schedule staff to utilize all mobile scanners. If stores cannot schedule four\nassociates at a time, they must plan to schedule no fewer than two associates\nto complete markdowns together.\nb) In UKG Pro, use the Shift Transfer function to identify specific associate shifts\nfor markdown scanning execution. If an associate’s primary job location is the\nFront End, a shift transfer to the Backroom should be completed when they are\nscheduled to process a truck. This update will appropriately bucket that shift’s\npayroll to the Backroom and reflect on the associate’s schedule.\n8",

The\nmarkdown compliance rate is measured as the total number of markdown-eligible items\nin an active cycle divided by the number of actual marked items (items scanned and\ntagged as a markdown), multiplied by 100. (e.g. 2500 markdowns to be scanned\nagainst 1855 markdown items scanned yields a 74.2% markdown compliance rate)\nSTORE MARKDOWNS PROCEDURE\nAs store Management completes the markdown planning process, the next step is to\nbegin scanning merchandise on the markdown file start date. The goal is to efficiently\nscan all items once and minimize time spent on researching and revisiting missed\nand/or incomplete departments or categories. Throughout markdown execution, store\nmanagement must ensure that sales and the customer experience remain a top priority.\nThe following guidelines, both during and after the completion of markdown scanning,\nmust be met thoroughly and consistently to ensure an optimal impact on store sales,\nmerchandise presentation, profitability, and loss prevention.\nMarkdown Scanning Process\nScanning is to begin in a timely manner and in coordination with the markdown plan and\nschedule. Follow these execution steps to complete the markdown scanning process:\n1) Pre-Scanning Recovery: For those departments scheduled to begin\nmarkdown scanning, ensure a detailed recovery (sizing and reticketing)\noccurs the day before. Use the Markdown Execution Planner to manage this.\n2) Returns & Holds: By the end of each business day, all merchandise returned\nby our customer or released from an expired merchandise hold must first be\nscanned by a front-end associate to check markdown status before being\nreturned to the sales floor.\n10",

If scanning all cycles in the same file, always start with apparel and\nend with hardlines.\na. Example: Women’s apparel is in the front, lefthand side of the store.\nAssociates would begin with this department, scanning the department\nfront-to-back, scanning each category in that order, first scanning the wall,\nthen moving to each rack, then to the feature at the end of each rack\nbefore moving on to the next category. Upon completing the scan of the\nentire Women’s apparel department, associates would move to the next\napparel department behind Women’s and continue the same scan flow.\nb. Scan each department to completion as a team, ensuring not to forget\nfeatures, display shelves with live merchandise, and mannequins or busts.\nc. Do not start Initial cycles in seasonal departments or categories that\nhave just arrived in store without first reviewing the Store Ops Price\nChange Report to understand current markdown quantities (e.g. do not\nscan for markdowns in swimwear if it has just arrived to store and the\nStore Ops Price Change Report shows no markdown units).\n4) Scanning & Label Placement: As merchandise is scanned, the mobile\nscanner will notify the associate both on screen and via audible alert if a\nmarkdown is needed. If so, the paired printer will automatically print the\ncorresponding clearance label. As each label prints, associates should\nimmediately align and affix the label to either completely cover the existing\nregular-price or clearance gum tag or cover the lowest section of a hang tag\nwithout concealing the regular price. On a hang tag, it is important to keep\nboth the regular price and clearance price visible to showcase value and\nsavings to our customers.\n5) Merchandise Movement: As Associates scan and mark down merchandise,\nthose items must be removed from their full-price fixtures and placed on a\ndesignated markdown processing fixture, such as a Z-Rack or Tank,\ndepending on the merchandise type and/or department.\na. After scanning all merchandise in each department, associates must\npause before moving on to the next department and first complete the re-\nmerchandising of all newly marked-down merchandise to the appropriate\nclearance selling area/s and/or fixture/s. Clearance remerchandising is\na critical step and should be continually completed throughout the\nmarkdown scanning process.\n11",

It is recommended that the MOD\nfollow up with all associates to provide recovery feedback and actions, as\nnecessary, to ensure the store’s merchandise presentation is meeting and\nexceeding expectations.\n8) Unfound Item Reconciliation: After all departments have been 100%\nscanned, store management must run the Store Ops Price Change report to\nview their Rough Capture Rate. To support achieving and exceeding scan\ncapture goals, stores should review all remaining markdown items to be\nscanned to determine which and how many items are outstanding. This\nprocess is called reconciliation. The MOD should then assign a department-\nfiltered report to one associate per department to have those associates\nsearch for any unfound items. Any items found during this search must then\nbe scanned for markdowns.\na. This activity should be assigned and executed before store opening or,\nif not before opening, during morning business hours. This will ensure\noptimal staff attention to service and recovery as customer traffic\nincreases throughout the afternoon and evening.\nb. Remember, before running the report, select ‘No’ from the Printed field\nto show only those units that have not been scanned. Once the report\nloads, Managers can export it to Excel to enable editing. Once loaded\nin Excel, the report can be filtered and separated by department.\n13",

Once tracked, the Service\nCenters are responsible for the disposition of all affected freight.\nMisdirected Freight\nDuring the shipping process, cartons are sometimes loaded to the incorrect location or\nhave an unreadable or missing Carton ID (CID) label. Once these cartons (misdirects)\narrive at a Service Center, an accurate count will be made, and all affected cartons will\nbe placed in a designated SC staging area for further review.\nDamaged Freight\nDuring the shipping and handling process, cartons can sometimes become damaged.\nThis is defined as any visible damage to a carton that prevents the safe movement of\nthe carton or its contents to its intended destination. (e.g. a carton is water damaged\ndue to a trailer leak) Once these cartons (damages) are identified in a Service Center,\nthey will be placed in a designated SC staging area for further review.\nDump Stores\nEach Service Center must have a designated Dump Store. A Dump Store is a retail\nstore location that is responsible for receiving certain misdirected and damaged freight\non behalf of the Service Center and manages the final disposition of that freight. The\nlocation of each Dump Store is decided upon by the Store Operations team.\nMISDIRECT & DAMAGE ROUTING\nAll misdirected cartons, whether loaded to the incorrect location or having an\nunreadable/missing CID, are logged on an SC Misdirect Form, which captures the trailer\ninformation and originating Distribution Center (Origin DC). Service Centers are then\nresponsible for deciding where to send misdirected and damaged freight, using the\ncriteria described below.\n1",

Dump Store\nManagement will not be notified when misdirects are included in their deliveries.\nSending Damages to a Dump Store\nEach Service Center will log all damaged cartons and send them to their designated\nDump Store on a regular basis.\nUpon Receipt, the Dump Store will then accept this freight as their own, following all\nstandard receiving steps, processing all salable merchandise to the sales floor, and\nprocessing all damages in accordance with the guidelines listed in this SOP.

Training will encompass a\nreview of what items fall into the hazardous and regulated waste categories and how to properly\nPurpose\nhandle and dispose of this waste.\nTo promote the importance and execution of proper Hazardous Waste disposal procedures with all\nAssociates, we have a new Hazardous Waste slogan – “Know It, Before You Throw It”. Use the slogan\nto help remind Associates that they should always ask how to dispose of all marked out of stock\nmerchandise.\nEnsure Associates clearly understand their role in:\n• Identifying the different types of merchandise that are considered hazardous and regulated waste\nImpact while recovering, taking markdowns and processing returns, etc.\n• Removal of hazardous materials and separate from common waste according to government\nguidelines\nTypes of Discuss the 6 categories of hazardous and regulated waste.

Universal Waste\nDiscuss segregating hazardous and regulated waste.\nDamaged or defective merchandise considered hazardous and regulated must be separated from\nthe store’s common waste and not disposed of in the store trash or recycling bins.\nSeparating\n• All hazardous and regulated waste must be segregated by category, processed and placed\nHazardous & appropriately in the store’s Hazardous and Regulated Waste Collection Area bins located in the\nRegulated backroom.\nWaste • Foyer and restroom trash receptacles must be lined with clear plastic bags and checked to ensure\nthey are free from hazardous and regulated waste. Any hazardous and regulated waste must be\nremoved before placing it with common trash. Use gloves and goggles when necessary.\nOnly Coordinators, Key Carriers or Store Management can make the decision on which bin hazardous\nor regulated waste should be placed in after it is marked out of stock.\nDisposal into\nHazardous &\nOnce an Associate marks an item out of stock and a Coordinator or above must notified to determine\nRegulated\nif the item qualifies as regulated or hazardous waste.

Store Operations will provide each DM with sales and transaction\nstatistics early in the holiday planning period to identify the top volume comp store locations,\nfocusing on the busiest periods of the 4th quarter. In addition, any high-growth and/or high-traffic\nnon-comp store locations will be reviewed. The DM’s will work with their applicable SM’s to\nfinalize decisions on needs and placement. Prior to the beginning of Q4, all final decisions will\nbe shared with the IT Implementation Team to prepare the temporary register install plan and\nfinalize the dates of hardware delivery and installation. All temporary register installation details\nwill be communicated to the affected stores by the Store Operations team.\nRegister Delivery & Installation\n■ Delivery of Temporary Registers\nAll temporary registers will be shipped to selected stores based on the pre-determined\nstore delivery schedule, created by IT Implementation, and communicated by Store Operations.\nPlease refer to this schedule to find each store’s planned delivery and installation dates. It is\nrecommended that the Store Manager communicate the delivery and installation details with\ntheir store leadership team to ensure that all leaders can support this process.

Please refer to the included\nimage as an example of recommended register\nplacement (2.5).\n■ Register Installation\nOn the scheduled day of register installation, a vendor\nTechnician will contact the store to share an estimated\ntime of arrival. Upon arrival, the Technician is required\nTEMPORARY EXISTING to follow all local, state and TJX safety protocols, sign-\nREGISTER REGISTER\nin and provide the current security code before\nbeginning any work. The Technician will ask for the\nhardware packages that had previously been\ndelivered and will verify the specific location of installation with the Store Manager. The\ntechnician is responsible for managing the installation of all register components, including all\nhardware, wiring, cable management (refer to images 2.7, 2.8), and box/trash clean-up. During\nthe installation, the Technician will require access to the store server room and to all areas of\nthe front-end. At the end of the installation, the Technician will perform a systems and hardware\ntest, including a test transaction, to ensure that the temporary register has been successful\nsetup and is ready to turn over to the store.\n2.6 Tablecloth Covering, All Four Sides STORE ACTIONS:\n- Store Managers, or a key-carrying designee, should have\nall delivered register hardware packages prepared for the\nTechnician’s arrival\n- The store must provide and prepare a temporary\n(banquet) table and matching tablecloth cover, placing it in\nthe area where the temporary register will be located on the\nday of the scheduled installation. The temporary table\nshould be no less than 48 inches and no more than 72\ninches in length and 24 inches in width. The tablecloth can\nbe either a neutral gray or holiday red in color and must\ncompletely and correctly cover both the top and all four\n2.6 Temporary Table sides of the table. Please refer to the included images (2.5-\n2.7).\n- Store Manager, or the Manager-on-Duty (MOD) should\ncomplete a test transaction while the Technician is still\non-premises. In addition, the MOD should verify that the\ntemporary register logon information has been provided,\nincluding register username and password. The register\npassword is usually provided in the form of a barcode, for\neasy Associate scanning/logon.\n- The store must retain the Register Shell box, keeping it on-premises and in good\ncondition. This box will be used again to ship the temporary register back to the\ntechnology depot, after the holiday season. Please refer to image 2.3.\n- The Store Manager, or MOD designee, must ensure that the Technician has provided\nthem with the keys to the register till/cash drawer prior to the Technician’s departure.\n3\nUpdated 10/19/2021",

Temporary registers are to be placed in the farthest left-hand position of the table,\nfacing the Cashier. The customer Pin-Pad must be placed adjacent to the left-hand side of the\nregister and positioned to the outer edge of the table, facing the Customer. The barcode\nscanner and included stand will be placed on the right-hand side of the register and positioned\nto the outer edge of the table, facing the Cashier. Please refer to image 2.5 as an example of\nthe proper position and setup of a temporary register.\nAs Customers present their selected merchandise to the Cashier, the temporary register\nworkspace must be setup efficiently to easily accept all merchandise categories, remove\nhangers and tagging and provide appropriate bagging. The following guidelines will provide an\noverview of how to best handle merchandise movement and register supplies. Stores are to\ntake action on all listed recommendations.\n● Merchandise Processing\nThe right-hand tabletop surface of the temporary register table\n3.1 Under-table Storage Area\nmust be kept clear, between each Customer transaction, to\nensure an open and approachable space from which to greet our\nCustomer and accept their merchandise selections. All\nmerchandise processing will occur in this space, including\nscanning, tag/hanger removal (if applicable) and final presentation\nsteps before the bagging process. Please follow all current\ncheckout procedures as it relates to apparel presentation\nstandards, handling oversized items and processing returned\nmerchandise.\n3.2 Under-table Organization\n● Hangers & EAS Tags\nStores are recommended to setup an under-table organization\nmethod to support merchandise supplies. This can be best\nachieved through using two shipment cartons, with flaps folded\ninward, to create temporary storage for both removed hangers (all\nhanger types) and all Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS)\n4\nUpdated 10/19/2021",

On high-traffic days and/or\nbetween Cashier shifts, it is critical that both the Cashier and MOD\nmonitor the accumulation of these supplies and empty the cartons\nper existing front-end procedures. When the register is not in use,\nthe table cover should be placed back in-front of the boxes to\nmaintain a neat and organized appearance. Please refer to\nimages 3.1 and 3.2.\n● Shopping Bags\nDue to the size of the temporary register table, it can be difficult to\nplace shopping bag supply below the table, where hanger and\nEAS tag storage resides. Due to the temporary register being\nlocated directly adjacent to an existing register, is recommended\nthat the Cashier share the shopping bag stock with that existing\nregister. During a transaction, small shopping bags may be staged\non top of the table, in the merchandise processing area. Likewise,\nlarge shopping bags may be staged on the floorspace adjacent to\nthe register table, providing easy bagging access for the Cashier.\nLike other front-end supplies, it is critical that both the Cashiers\nand MOD monitor the availability of these supplies throughout the\nday and re-stock as necessary.\nRegister Deinstallation\nAs the stores initial construction, remodel project or holiday selling season comes to an end, the\nStore Operations team will partner with the IT Implementation team to plan the deinstallation of\nall applicable temporary registers. The finalized deinstallation schedule will be shared with all\naffected District Managers and Store Managers in a timely manner. Like installation, there will\nbe a vendor Technician scheduled for an on-site deinstallation of each temporary register.\nSTORE ACTIONS:\n- The store must prepare the original Register Shell box and keep it in an easily accessible\nlocation for the Technician. This will be used to ship the temporary register back to the\ntechnology depot. Please refer to image 2.3.\nKey Contacts\nStore Operations Team: Brent Bisson (brent_bisson@tjx.com)\nTechnical Support: For pre-installation, contact Store Operations.
